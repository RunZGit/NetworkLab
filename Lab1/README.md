# Programming Assignment 1 Web Server

## Assumptions:

Required: python2.7
HTTP standard: 1.0   

### Server
* All the files are stored in the ./Upload directory. 
* Only GET and HEAD methods are supported. 
* By default, debug mode is off. Once it is on, the server will run on localhost instead of the socket.getHostName(). 
* The server is designed using builder pattern, which you can reference from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern).
* To stop the server, type <kbd>âŒƒc</kbd>.

### Client
* All the files are downloaded in the ./Download folder
* Client only supports GET and HEAD methods. 
* If GET method succeed, it will only store the body of the response.
* Else and other methods will only displayed the response to terminal.
* By default, the client will only throw error message 'Your input has problems!'. If you believe that is not the case, please remove the try catch clause surronding the main(args) call.
* If requested file is large, user has the option to check the downloading progress. Simply add 'True' at the end of the command will turn this option on.
